InsightForge is a platform designed to explore AI-augmented engineering.
It focuses on retrieval-augmented generation, semantic search, and system-first design.

The goal is to help engineers build explainable, controlled AI systems.
These systems keep humans in the loop and reduce hallucinations.

AI is not replacing humans but it is trying to teach them more efficiently and humanely rather than wasting time on useless thought and of course they are the better teacher than anyone currently and also better worker except taking cognitive decisions depending on a particular situation and also not responsible for any damage so a supervisor who understands and can communicate with AI effectively and efficienly must be there.

Generative AI Systems Engineering (Independent Work)
InsightForge
Designed and developed a full-stack AI-assisted application using React, FastAPI (Python), and PostgreSQL, integrating LLM-powered features for intelligent text-based workflows. Built modular backend services emphasizing clean architecture, extensibility, and API-driven design. Utilized local LLM inference via Ollama for cost-efficient, privacy-aware development and rapid experimentation.
RAG & Event-Driven Asynchronous AI Pipeline
Architected an event-driven, asynchronous Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for document ingestion and query answering. Implemented document loading, chunking, embedding, and vector storage using FAISS, along with custom retrieval and scoring logic beyond default cosine similarity for improved relevance control. Built FastAPI-based GenAI services exposed via CLI, with the architecture designed for agent-based extensions and future UI integration.
