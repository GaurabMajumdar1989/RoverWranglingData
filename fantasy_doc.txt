In the luminous kingdom of Aethelgard, the sky is a swirling tapestry of violet and gold, illuminated by three moons that never set. Here, the landscape is defined by floating islands of crystalline rock connected by bridges of solid light, where the "Scribes of the Air" harvest stardust to power their ancient machinery. Magic is not a hidden art but a rhythmic pulse felt by every living creature, flowing through the roots of the silver-leafed Eldertrees that hum in harmony with the wind.
The peace of this realm is guarded by the Winged Sentinels, warriors who ride majestic gryphons through the shifting clouds of the Upper Reach. Deep within the Obsidian Canyons, however, a low resonance has begun to stir, the place of Primal Ember-spirits which lies dormant for a thousand years thus signaling the awakening of it of the world's core. As the ground begins to glow with an eerie azure light, the people of Aethelgard must prepare for an era where the balance between the ethereal heights and the forgotten depths will finally be tested.
